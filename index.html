            The first Western abstract paintings known were done by Swedish
            woman Hilma af Klint (born 1862). Klint spent many summers at her
            family manor on the island of Adelso in Lake Malaren, where she
            became surrounded and found herself profoundly in contact with
            nature. Klint was a part of a group, “The Five” which consisted of
            four other women who were highly inspired by Theosophy. Klint’s
            paintings tend to be visual representations of highly complex
            spiritual concepts. The Five were known to believe in reaching out
            to higher powers typically in the form of seances. Klint’s
            abstraction predates the very men whose names are the definition of
            abstraction within the art community; Kandinsky, Mondrian, Malevich
            and Kupka.

            Hilma was the fourth child in her family. Her Parents were Mathilda
            af Klint and Captain Victor af Klint of the Swedish navy. Hilma’s
            family was the source of her interest in the fields of mathematics
            and botany. She demonstrated a considerable ability in visual art at
            a young age, and began studying at an art school in Stockholm after
            her family moved there. It was here that she learned portraiture and
            landscape painting. <br /><br />At the age of twenty she was
            admitted at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. Here she studied
            drawing, portraiture, and landscape painting. She excelled at the
            academy, graduating with honors and being given her own studio as a
            scholarship. The building housing the studio was owned by the Royal
            Academy of Fine Arts, and was the main cultural hub in Stockholm at
            the time. It also housed Blanch’s Cafe and Blanch’s Art Gallery,
            which was a site of conflict between conventional artistic views and
            the more contemporary views of the “Art Society” inspired by French
            En Plein Air painters. After graduating, Hilma began working in
            Stockholm and gaining recognition for her artwork.

            While at the Academy of fine arts, Klint met a women named Anna
            Cassel, who was the first of the other four women who would later
            form “The Five”. The Five began as members of the Edelweiss Society,
            which embraced theosophical teachings of Helena Blavatsy as well as
            spiritualism. The Five also had an interest in the paranormal and
            frequently, held seances. Every one of their meetings began with a
            prayer, meditation, a Christian sermon, and an analysis of a text
            from the New Testament, then closing with a seance. The group
            created and recorded a new system of mystical thought which was
            inspired by messages from higher spirits they called The High
            Masters. In essence, the system upheld spiritual knowledge above
            intellect.<br /><br />
            Klint’s work with The Five led to her experimentation with automatic
            drawing as early as 1896, which further developed into her inventive
            geometric visual language. With this she explored religion, atoms,
            and nature, and she documented her findings extensively. Supposedly,
            she was tasked by the High Masters to create the paintings for the
            so-called “Temple”, but she never fully understood what this meant.
            She felt she was being guided by a force which would physically
            influence the movement of her hand.<br /><br />
            In 1906, after a 20 year artistic career, Klint painted her first
            series of abstract paintings. She also completed the works for the
            Temple between 1906 and 1915, done in two phases with a hiatus from
            1908 to 1912. As she developed her new abstract style, she once
            again developed a new artistic language. The spiritual remained the
            main source of creativity for the remainder of her life.

            Hilma Klint specified in her will that her work should be kept a
            secret for at least 20 years after her death. She did this because
            she felt her work was too advanced for people at the time. When the
            boxes of her work were eventually opened, only a small group of
            people had knowledge of what was going to be revealed. <br /><br />
            Her art was introduced to an international audience in 1984 thanks
            to the art historian Ake Fant, when he presented it at a Nordik
            conference in Helsinki. Her collection of abstract work includes
            more than 1200 works, and is now managed by a foundation named for
            her and located in Stockholm.
